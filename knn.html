<h1> Modified PointNet++</h1>
<body>
    We have noted three opportunities in the PointNet++ architecture to make changes. They are presented in the:
    Set Abstraction layer: 
    <br>a. Sampling: PointNet++ uses Distance Farthest Point Sampling to sample points for the SA layers, inspired from ECC we have implemented a new Fusion sampling method which also uses feature distance sampling to create a better SA.
    <br>b. Grouping: PointNet++ groups the points using query ball point method. We have experimented with the k-nearest neighbour algorithm for grouping to see if we can achieve any performance increases.
    Local & Global information aggregation via Interpolation: The original PointNet++ paper uses interpolation to merge all the features learnt from the set abstraction layers. Interpolation is a very time-consuming and inefficient method, we have tried to improve performance by replicating with nearest neighbours features.
