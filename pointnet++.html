<h1> PointNet++</h1>
<body>
    PointNet++ was introduced as an improvement over PointNet by the original authors of the paper. While PointNet was reasonably successful at 3d recognition, its architecture failed to capture local structure induced by the metric space
    To solve this PointNet++ proposes a hierarchical neural network which essentially partitions the input set and recursively uses PointNet for 3d recognition.
